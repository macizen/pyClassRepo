# final project proposal
## mac sanmiguel
For my final project, I want to make a python program that interacts with a midi device and computer audio in real time. The program will be generating melodies along with the notes that the user inputs, creating a duet. My plan is to use a preexisting script that I have that describes musical notes as objects and strings, and build up from there. My script does not have integration with midi, so I need to figure that out. As for some libraries that would be helpful to me, pygame has a [midi module](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/midi.html) that might work for my use case. Something that looks very promising is [this library](https://github.com/patrickkidd/pyrtmidi) I found on GitHub that allows realtime input and output from a midi device. I'm not sure whether I will be using a python library for audio synthesis (so that there is an audible output) or if I should have the program interact with a preexisting program that I have like [ableton live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) or [max msp](https://cycling74.com/products/max)
