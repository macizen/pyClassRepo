# two player versus shooter game
## mac sanmiguel 

### CONTROLS:
player 1: wasd for movement, x to shoot
player 2: ijkl for movement, m to shoot

I modified the example game we made in class to make a two player version where each player competes against the other to get the most points possible.
The basic features of the game are of course moving and shooting, but also a scoreboard that counts each player's score, a "magazine" that represents how many bulelts each player has, and randomly spawning ammo boxes that players can use to refill their bullets.
The game is technically infinite becuase I didn't add a maximum score or win screen. 

If you want to play the game, you can use [this tool](https://download-directory.github.io/) to download [this folder](https://github.com/macizen/pyClassRepo/tree/main/pygame) from my repo and run it in a virtual environment on vs code.
